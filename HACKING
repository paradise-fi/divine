A Hacker's Guide
================

This chapter is intended for DIVINE developers, writing algorithms, backends or
working on various framework components. Before starting with DIVINE, it is
advisable that you first try to compile the tool (see README) and find out how
the `divine` binary and other components work.

The development work is co-ordinated through the `divine` at `fi.muni.cz`
mailing list, and through a [trac instance] [1] which has (most importantly)
our [issue tracker] [2] and also a [source code browser] [3]. We also run a
[continuous integration server] [4], based on Hydra.

Using Darcs
-----------

The source tree of divine is kept in the darcs revision control system.

You need a darcs 2.x binary (see <http://www.darcs.net>) to check out the
source and to record patches. After installing darcs, there is a single "main"
branch, which you should use as a base for your work. Get a copy by issuing:

    $ darcs get http://divine.fi.muni.cz/darcs/mainline divine

Now, you should have a directory called divine, which contains a copy of the
source code. You can modify a few files in there, and issue

    $ darcs whatsnew
    $ darcs record

You will notice that, unlike CVS, `darcs` will ask you which changes to record
(or commit, in the CVS vocabulary). Also, `darcs` will ask you for a short
patch name. You are encouraged to only record small changes at once, so that
you can describe the change in a single line. Of course, for bigger changes (or
those that need more explanation), you can still include a longer description
after the short one (darcs will ask). The description should be an English
sentence, starting with a capital letter and ending with a period. It should
preferably be no longer than 80 characters. We commonly prefix the short
description with a single word describing the component it affects.

Now, after you provide this data, darcs will run the testsuite, to ensure you
didn't break anything. However, this is most often something you do not want to
happen, and should disable in your personal repo (you can always run the suite
with `make check`). Prevent darcs from running the tests with:

    $ echo "ALL no-test" > _darcs/prefs/default

Another important command is:

    $ darcs changes -s -i

This will let you browse the recent changes, with summary of changed files in
each. You can hit `v` in the interactive prompt to inspect the change in
detail. Use spacebar to advance to the next older patch.

When you record a change you don't like, you can use `darcs unrecord` to remove
the recorded patch. Note however, that the changes will be kept in the working
copy, so you can `darcs record` them again, or `darcs revert` them, if you are
sure you want to remove them forever.

If you have changes that you would like to have included within the main divine
branch, it is probably best to send those changes by mail. They will be
reviewed and added to the repository as appropriate.

    $ darcs send

Alternatively, you can publish your darcs repository (e.g. using a public http
hosting service, or you can try [patch-tag] [6] or [darcsden] [7]). Then
contact the maintainer and ask them to merge your changes into mainline.

[6]: http://www.patch-tag.com
[7]: http://darcsden.com

Over time, the mainline will accumulate some changes, and you will probably
want to stay in sync with those. It is advisable that before merging from
mainline, you record all your unrecorded changes. Then, you may issue:

    $ darcs pull

Which will ask you which changes would you like to bring into your branch. Most
of the time, you should not see any conflicts, as darcs handles merging
automatically (unless there are real conflicts).

If you get spurious conflicts when pulling, it is advisable that you `darcs
get` a new copy of the mainline repository and use `darcs pull` to move your
local changes from your previous copy. This means that some patches have been
removed from the mainline, although this happens only very rarely.

You can build divine the same way as you would when using distribution
tarballs, although you may need to `chmod +x ./configure` first. Please see
README for further details.

* **tools/** is for binaries

  * **tools/divine.cpp** is the main user-level entry point of the tool

* **external/** the external code used in DIVINE such as the libc++ library,
    the murphi compiler for divine, or the parallel allocators.
* **bricks/** is the bricks C++ library used for threading, command line
  parsing and a couple of other utilities used throughout the code
* **gui/** is the Qt graphical interface of divine

The following sections talk about various parts of the source code in more
detail.

### Wibble

DIVINE uses libwibble, a general-purpose utility library for C++ for several
things. Most importantly, the threading abstraction is provided by this library
and comes with a pthread-based and a win32-based implementation.

### The Toolkit

In **divine/toolkit**, you will find the parts of divine that are most
generic. High-performance hash tables, a very simple RPC protocol over MPI,
memory allocation, parallel execution and distributed termination
detection. This code is not really specific to model checking or graph
exploration, but is geared toward high-performance computing.

* **parallel.h**: A simple parallel work domain using shared memory and
  threads. Used as a basic building block for parallel sections of other code.
* **barrier.h**: A termination-detecting barrier for a bunch of threads. Used
  in the implementation of parallel.h.
* **fifo.h**: A simple one-way communication primitive for shared memory,
  without locking. Used by parallel.h to implement inter-thread communication.
* **hashset.h**: The current implementation of a hash table for use as a
  set. Primarily intended to use with **Blob** objects.
* **ntreehashset.h** The implementation of tree compressed hash set
  to facilitate lossless state space compression. It uses either
  hashset or concurrentset backend.
* **concurrentset.h** The implementation of high-performance shared memory
  resizeable hash table.
* **blob.h**: A semi-smart pointer. Addresses an object with known size and a
  couple of flag bits. No reference counting.
* **pool.h**: A very fast **Blob** object allocator designed for efficient
  handling of short-lived objects. It is suitable for allocating huge
  numbers of objects that only come in a small number of different sizes.
* **rpc.h**: A generic but very simple marshalling/demarshalling layer, used in
  implementing MPI.
* **mpi.h**: Implementation of the MPI layer, built on top of the work domain
  implementation available in parallel.h. Semi-transparent for client code, see
  also rpc.h.

### Graph Traversal

Another set of modules of the divine library implements a graph interface and
parallel graph traversal utilities. These live in **divine/graph**.

* **datastruct.h**: Implements the data structures for graph traversal, a BFS
  queue and a DFS stack, tailored for use with the generic graph visitor.
* **visitor.h**: A number of generic graph exploration algorithms. Both
  breadth-first and depth-first sequential visitors are available as building
  blocks, and a single static-partitioning parallel one (breadth-first based,
  but without layer synchronisation).

### Algorithms

The actual model-checking algorithms can be found under
**divine/algorithm**. The common infrastructure is found in **common.h**, and
builds heavily on the parallel primitives from **toolkit**.

* **owcty.h**: The staple parallel algorithm for detecting accepting cycles.
* **nested-dfs.h**: Nested DFS search, another staple algorithm, but sequential.
* **map.h.**: Maximal Accepting Predecessor, a parallel algorithm like OWCTY,
  but usually slower.
* **reachability.h**: Parallel reachability analysis, search for deadlock or
  goal states. (See also section on generators below.)
* **metrics.h**: A very efficient parallel state space generator. Suitable for
  obtaining state space statistics and for benchmarking.
* **genexplicit.h**: Algorithm used to generate the DESS explicit state
  space format.

### Generators

The state space generators, or system interpreters, are a major part of
DIVINE. Each is usually split into two parts, the bulk of the implementation of
a given language living under its own subdirectory in **divine/**, and a
comparatively small *adaptor* -- a piece of code that implements a standardised
graph-traversal interface on top of the interpreter -- found under
**divine/generator**. The adaptor interface is declared in **divine/graph**.

The currently available generators are:

* **divine/cesmi**: Not a language interpreter, but a binary interface for
  shared objects. See the [user manual] [8] for the specification of its
  API/ABI.
* **divine/dve**: The DVE language. The most traditional of DIVINE input
  languages.
* **divine/timed**: Interpreter for UPPAAL Timed Automata.
* **divine/llvm**: LLVM bitcode interpreter, suitable for verifying C(++) code.
* **divine/coin**: CoIn, aka Component-Interaction Automata.
* **divine/explicit**: Simple generator for loading DESS (DIVINE explicit
  state space) files.

### Instances

The basic components of divine are implemented as C++ templates, for various
reasons (performance, static type safety). As such, a "configuration" of
divine: the input language interpreter, the model checking algorithm and the
state storage subsystem need to be combined at compile time, obtaining a single
tight unit with minimal configuration-related branching in the hot code
paths. The code in **divine/instances** takes care of both instructing the
compiler to emit code for the sensible combinations of modules, as well as
provide the code to translate runtime configuration into the correct entry
point of the combined system.

### LTL to Büchi translation

In order to perform LTL model checking, DIVINE needs to translate LTL formulas
into Büchi automata. There are currently two components which implement this
translation, the "traditional" ltl2ba which has been part of DIVINE since
forever, found in **divine/ltl2ba** and a "modern" implementation based on the
unrelated external tool called, confusingly, "LTL2BA". The implementation
shipped with DIVINE is however called LTL3BA and is found in
**external/ltl3ba**. There is a compile time option to enable/disable LTL3BA.

### Tools

This directory hosts parts of the divine source that comprise the command line
interface. These files are not part of the divine library, although certain
modules may move to the library over time.

* **divine.cpp**: This is the main entrypoint of the divine CLI. It implements
  command line parsing and based on the command line calls into the library or
  into other tools (model compiler, combine).
* **compile.h**, **compile.cpp**: Entry point of the model compiler. Calls into
  either the DVE or the Murphi compiler to generate C++ code and executes an
  external C++ compiler on the result.
* **compile-pml.pl**, **packjars.pl**: Parts of an external Java-based ProMeLa
  compiler. Currently not part of `divine compile`, only available as a
  standalone tool.
* **combine.h**: Implementation of `divine combine`. Calls out to (external)
  `cpp`, `m4` and into the ltl2ba part of the divine library to translate
  dve/mdve/ltl files into raw DVE.

### GUI

Finally, the **gui** directory contains the sources of a graphical user
interface for the DIVINE tool, based on Qt 4.x. Comes with a DVE simulator and
counterexample browser.

Debugging
---------

When debugging DIVINE with **`gdb`**, no special precautions are usually
needed. You however probably want a build with debugging enabled and
optimisations disabled: pass `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to obtain such a
build. This also enables assertion checking, which is definitely useful for
debugging.

Moreover, when using **`valgrind`** to hunt down leaks and/or memory
corruption, it is often desirable do disable custom memory management: pass
`-DTBBMALLOC=OFF` (in addition to the above) at configure time to
achieve this.
